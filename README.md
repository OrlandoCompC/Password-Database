# Password-Database
A password database with a password checker incorporated

It is a password database where the user can add a new user, change or delete a password
In order to do some functions they must add the admin password which is "Password1"
It uses a file which the user can later view, I made it so that each time the program restarts
the file is rewritten with only one user.

If the the admind tries to add a new user, they must have a proper password which has:
  Length greater than 12 characters
  Uppercase letters
  Lowercase letters
